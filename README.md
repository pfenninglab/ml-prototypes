# Machine Learning scripts

This is a place to put all rough scripts and prototypes of scripts that are yet to be converted to final product. These may be tailored to the specific task and also may be quick scripts put together just to run a machine learning algorithm on a dataset.

## JUND Analysis Scripts

* Script to convert input sequences to k-mer count representations
* Script to simulate random substitutions on input sequences
* Script to extract a subset of sequences from a fasta file
* Ipython Notebook to run a random forest and SVM classifier on k-mer representations of JUND ChIP-Seq peaks
